# TinyApp Project (Lighthouse Labs)
TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Background

- This four-day mini project was completed as part of the Week 3 assignment.
- Built HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way I was introduced to some advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, learned about Express (a web framework) and also had fun learning about styling using Bootstrap4.
